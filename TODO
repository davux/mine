  - The game doesn't show well in many browsers.
  - It's not possible to remove a flag.
  - The current way to set a flag is not very practical.
  - It's possible to go on playing after a game is won or lost.

Nice desired features...
  - A time counter.
  - Detection of a won game (with the sunglasses guy).
  - Equivalent to the middle-click in standard game: open all remaining boxes around a
    resolved number (for instance the number says '2' and you already found the 2 bombs,
    so middle-clicking on the '2' opens the remaining boxes around).
