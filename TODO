If you want to help, go ahead! Please remember that no Javasript is allowed.
Also, I would like to stick with a static CSS file, if possible.

Problems.
  - The game doesn't show well in many browsers.
  - The current way to set a flag is not very practical.
  - It's possible to go on playing after a game is won or lost.

Nice desired features...
  - Detection of a won game:
    - sunglasses guy,
    - stop the counter,
    - lock the grid.
  - Equivalent to the middle-click in standard game: open all remaining boxes around a
    resolved number (for instance the number says '2' and you already found the 2 bombs,
    so middle-clicking on the '2' opens the remaining boxes around).

Appearance tweaks:
  - When a game is lost:
    - display the bombs in open boxes
    - show the misplaced flags
    - put a red background to the faulty mine
  - Use a push effect on the smiley button when pressed
