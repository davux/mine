  - The game doesn't show well in many browsers.
  - All adjacent blank boxes (boxes without a number or a bomb) get correctly
    opened at the same time. Still, the numbers surrounding that area don't get opened.
  - It's not possible to remove a flag.

Nice desired features...
  - A time counter.
  - Detection of a won game (with the sunglasses guy).
  - Equivalent to the middle-click in standard game: open all remaining boxes around a
    resolved number (for instance the number says '2' and you already found the 2 bombs,
    so middle-clicking on the '2' opens the remaining boxes around).
