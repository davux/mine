<h1>About CSS Minesweeper</h1>
</header>
<p>This is an equivalent to the well-known minesweeper game. The grid is generated in PHP, but the game itself is entirely static, made of HTML and CSS. No javascript.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML 5 markup (doesn't really matter :p).</li>
  <li>3 predefined difficulty levels, or you can change the <abbr title="width">w</abbr>, <abbr title="height">h</abbr> and <abbr title="number of mines">n</abbr> values in the URL.</li>
  <li>There's a counter for the remaining bombs to find.</li>
  <li>Share a given game with your friends by sending them the exact URL.</li>
  <li>Access your previously won and lost games through the history. If you want to play them again,
    simply remove them from the history.</li>
  <li>If your browser supports CSS3 transitions, a time counter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole code, including PHP, is available through git. Simply type:</p>
<code>$ git clone http://da.weeno.net/code/git-repo/mine.git</code>
