This is an equivalent to the well-known minesweeper game. The grid is generated in PHP, but
the game itself is entirely static, made of HTML and CSS. No javascript.

Features:
  - HTML 5 markup (doesn't really matter :p).
  - 3 predefined difficulty levels, or you can change the w (width) and h (height) values in the URL.
  - There's a counter for the remaining bombs to find.
  - Share a given game with your friends by sending them the exact URL.
  - Access your previously won and lost games through the history. If you want to play them again,
    simply remove them from the history.
  - If your browser supports CSS3 transitions, a time counter.

The whole code, including PHP, is available through git. Simply type:
$ git clone http://da.weeno.net/code/git-repo/mine.git

This game was started by David Ammouial in Jan 2010.
